# mobile-app-frontends

The purpose of this repository is to compare different mobile front-end technologies to see similarities and interesting patterns. This is not to show one framework is better than the others, but rather to get a feel for the developer experience. Similar to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) back in the day, it showed how to use different frameworks at the time to create the same web application. 

The application should be a good representation of a generic and standard mobile application, without getting too deep into cataloging every type of screen or component available. This will also focus on building UIs and not go into things like authentication or communicating with server backends. One last note is that these examples use all-or-nothing so they do not show how to integrate React Native or Nativescript into an existing mobile application for example. 

## App Structure

The app will have a fairly standard app bar with a menu and include these screens:

* Login screen
* Home screen
* List view
* Card list screen
* Detail screen
* Settings screen
